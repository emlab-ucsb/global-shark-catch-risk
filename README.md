# Instructions

The order of running scripts should be as follows: 

- The first scripts run should be from the `src/data-wrangling` folder. The scripts within this folder are labeled starting at `01`. Scripts with the same numbers can be run in any order. For example, it makes no difference whether you clean the ICCAT or IOTC data first, but all RFMO cleaning (scripts starting with `01` should be completed before moving on to `02_combine_all_rfmo_data.Rmd`). 
- The second scripts run should be from the `src/models` folder. The scripts within this folder are labeled starting at `01`.
- Additional scripts for figure and table creation in `src/figures` and `src/tables`, respectively, should be run after data wrangling and models, but order of scripts within these folders does not matter.

# Folder Schema

Please ensure that your folder schema is the same as described below to ensure that all codes run appropriately. Several datasets were pulled from independent sources for this modeling effort and can be found in `data-updated/[relevant-dataset]/inputs` folder. All data within `intermediate` or `output` folders are generated by the codes provided.
